# SQL Masker Tool - Features Summary

## **What This Tool Does**
This tool helps you **safely share SQL code with AI assistants** by replacing sensitive database names with fake ones, then restoring the real names after the AI helps you.

## **Main Features**

### **Basic Workflow**
1. **Paste your sensitive SQL** â†’ Tool finds table names, column names, etc.
2. **Replace with fake names** â†’ `customer_table` becomes `table_1`
3. **Share masked SQL with AI** â†’ AI can help without seeing real names
4. **Paste AI's response back** â†’ Tool restores original names automatically

### **What Gets Hidden**
- **Database names** (catalogs)
- **Schema names** 
- **Table names**
- **Column names**
- **String values** (like 'secret_data')
- **Custom function names**
- **Aliases** (short names for tables)

### **Smart Features**
- **Doesn't hide SQL keywords** â†’ Won't replace `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.
- **Avoids conflicts** â†’ Makes sure fake names don't clash with each other
- **Handles quotes properly** â†’ Works with both 'single' and "double" quotes

### **Easy Controls**
- **Pick what to hide** â†’ Uncheck items you don't want to mask
- **See before/after** â†’ Compare original vs masked SQL
- **View differences** â†’ See exactly what the AI changed
- **Copy with one click** â†’ Easy copying to clipboard

### **File Operations**
- **Load SQL files** â†’ Import .sql files directly
- **Save/Load mappings** â†’ Reuse the same fake names across sessions
- **Handle big files** â†’ Warns about large files that might be slow

### **Error Help**
- **Find SQL problems** â†’ Tells you about syntax errors
- **Suggest fixes** â†’ Gives specific advice for common problems
- **Test parsing** â†’ Check if your SQL will work before masking

### **Safety Features**
- **Conflict prevention** â†’ Avoids mixing up similar names
- **Quality checks** â†’ Makes sure SQL keywords aren't accidentally hidden
- **Backup originals** â†’ Never loses your original SQL

## ðŸš€ **Why Use This?**
- **Keep secrets safe** â†’ AI never sees your real database names
- **Get AI help** â†’ Still get code improvements and suggestions  
- **Save time** â†’ Automatic restoration means no manual find/replace
- **Reusable** â†’ Save mappings to use the same fake names again

## **Perfect For**
- Asking AI to optimize your SQL queries
- Getting help with complex database logic
- Sharing SQL examples without exposing company data
- Learning SQL with real structure but fake names
